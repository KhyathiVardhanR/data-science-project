# Measuring the Economic Impact of International Sanctions on Civilian Well-Being

Heilmeier Catechism – Project: International sanctions are commonly used as a foreign policy tool to influence the behavior of governments. While their political effectiveness is often discussed, the economic impact of sanctions on civilian populations is less clearly understood. This project aims to examine how international sanctions are associated with changes in key economic conditions that directly affect civilians.

1. What are you trying to do? 
We are trying to understand how the economic impact of international sanctions on civilians evolves over time and across key economic indicators.

2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Sanctions are usually evaluated based on political outcomes, while civilian economic impacts are studied separately. This makes it difficult to directly connect sanction events with changes in civilian economic conditions.

## Milestone 1 
This repository contains data acquisition and exploratory analysis
of World Bank economic indicators (inflation, unemployment, GDP growth)
for analyzing the impact of international sanctions on civilian well-being.

The analysis focuses on identifying short-term and long-term patterns in economic indicators following sanction events.
