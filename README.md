Heilmeier Catechism – Project: Measuring the Economic Impact of International Sanctions on Civilian Well-Being

1. What are you trying to do?
We are trying to understand whether international sanctions are linked to economic problems faced by everyday people in affected countries.

2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Sanctions are usually evaluated based on political outcomes, while civilian economic impacts are studied separately. This makes it difficult to directly connect sanction events with changes in civilian economic conditions.
