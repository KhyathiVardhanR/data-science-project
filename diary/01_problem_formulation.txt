Project Title

Assessing the Civilian Impact of International Sanctions on Economic and Social Well-Being


Problem Statement

International sanctions are intended to pressure governments, but their economic effects are often felt most strongly by civilians. While traditional analysis focuses on GDP, inflation, and unemployment, these macroeconomic indicators do not fully capture how sanctions affect everyday life.

Sanctions can disrupt trade, restrict access to foreign currency, reduce imports of essential goods such as food and medicine, and increase prices. These economic shocks may translate into higher poverty, worsening child health, rising inequality, and reduced household welfare.

This project examines whether international sanctions are associated with measurable changes in both economic and social indicators of civilian well-being over time.


Research Question

How do international sanctions affect civilian economic and social well-being, including macroeconomic conditions and household-level outcomes, over time?


Defined Inputs (Data)

The project combines multiple data sources:

1. Sanctions Data
- Sanction start and end dates
- Type of sanctions (financial, trade, sectoral, targeted)
- Severity indicators (number of sectors targeted, oil bans, banking restrictions, humanitarian exemptions)
Sources: Global Sanctions Data Base (GSDB), UN records, US Treasury (OFAC), EU sanctions database.

2. Economic Indicators
- GDP growth
- Inflation rate
- Unemployment rate
- Sectoral trade data (food, medicine, oil)
Sources: World Bank (WDI), IMF, ILOSTAT, UN Comtrade.

3. Household and Social Indicators
- Poverty rate
- Income inequality (Gini index)
- Child mortality (under-5 mortality rate)
- Nutrition and health indicators
- School enrollment
Sources: DHS surveys, UNICEF MICS, World Bank databases.

These variables allow measurement of both national economic shocks and real household-level impacts.


Defined Outputs

The project will produce:

- Time-series graphs showing trends before and after sanctions
- Statistical regression analysis estimating the relationship between sanctions and civilian outcomes
- Comparative analysis of targeted versus broader sanctions
- A potential composite civilian well-being index combining economic and social indicators


Time Horizon

The analysis will cover the period from 2000 to 2023, depending on data availability. This allows examination of multiple sanction episodes and long-term effects.


Why This Problem Matters

Sanctions are often described as targeted tools against governments, yet evidence suggests civilians may bear much of the economic cost. By combining macroeconomic, trade, and household-level data, this project provides a more complete and data-driven assessment of how sanctions affect civilian well-being.
