Data Exploration – Milestone 1


Overview

Initial exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the structure, consistency, and behavior of the multidimensional panel dataset. This dataset includes sanctions intensity measures, macroeconomic indicators, trade flows, and household-level social indicators. The objective of this stage was to identify patterns, detect data limitations, and evaluate the feasibility of later econometric modeling.


Descriptive Statistics

Summary statistics were generated for the following variables:

- Sanction intensity measures (event counts, severity indicators)
- GDP growth, inflation, unemployment
- Trade flows (food imports, medicine imports, oil exports)
- Social indicators (poverty rate, inequality, child mortality where available)

These statistics provided insight into distribution, central tendencies, outliers, and cross-country variation across years. Significant variation was observed in sanction intensity and trade volumes across countries and time periods.


Visual Exploration

Time-series plots were created to examine:

- Economic indicators before and after sanction periods
- Trade shocks in essential goods during high sanction years
- Changes in social indicators following major sanction episodes

Preliminary visual patterns suggest that sanction intensification often coincides with trade contraction and inflation spikes in certain cases. However, effects are heterogeneous across countries, suggesting context-specific transmission mechanisms.


Missing Values and Data Quality Assessment

Several data challenges were identified:

- Missing unemployment data for earlier years in certain countries
- Incomplete social indicators for some low-income countries
- High variability in sanction event counts due to differences in media reporting intensity
- Potential structural breaks during conflict years

Data cleaning strategies and imputation methods will be considered in future stages to address these gaps while maintaining analytical integrity.


Preliminary Observations

Initial exploration indicates that sanction periods are frequently associated with:

- Increased inflation
- Declines in trade flows of key sectors
- Greater volatility in economic indicators

However, the magnitude and persistence of effects vary across countries. This reinforces the need for structured causal methods such as Difference-in-Differences and event-study designs in subsequent analysis.


Next Steps

Future analysis will:

- Address missing values and standardize panel structure
- Explore lagged and dynamic effects of sanctions
- Conduct subgroup analysis (income level, region)
- Implement econometric models to test causal relationships
- Evaluate robustness using alternative sanction severity measures
