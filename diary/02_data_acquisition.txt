Data Acquisition – Milestone 1


Overview

This project uses a multidimensional dataset to examine the relationship between international sanctions and civilian economic and social well-being. Rather than relying on a single macroeconomic database, the analysis combines sanction event data, macroeconomic indicators, trade flows, and household-level social indicators. This approach allows for a more comprehensive and data-driven assessment of how sanctions affect civilian populations.


Data Source 1: Sanctions Data

Sanctions are identified and coded using multiple sources to ensure accuracy and completeness.

Primary Source:
- Global Sanctions Data Base (GSDB), which provides detailed information on sanction episodes, including start and end dates, type (trade, financial, targeted), and objectives.

Supplementary Sources:
- United Nations Security Council sanction records
- U.S. Treasury (OFAC) sanctions lists
- European Union sanctions database

Sanction Severity Index:
Using these sources, a sanction severity measure will be constructed based on:
- Number of sanctioning actors
- Sectors targeted (oil, banking, trade)
- Presence of financial restrictions
- Scope of trade embargo
- Humanitarian exemptions

Relevance:
This dataset allows sanctions to be measured not only as a binary variable (sanctioned or not), but also by intensity and scope over time.


Data Source 2: Macroeconomic Indicators

Macroeconomic data is obtained from publicly available global databases:

- World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
- International Monetary Fund (IMF) databases
- ILOSTAT for labor statistics

Key variables include:
- GDP growth
- Inflation rate
- Unemployment rate

Relevance:
These indicators capture overall economic conditions and allow comparison of economic performance before and after sanction episodes.


Data Source 3: Trade and Sectoral Data

To understand transmission channels of sanctions, trade data will be collected from:

- UN Comtrade database

Key variables include:
- Imports of food
- Imports of medicine
- Fuel imports
- Oil exports

Relevance:
Sanctions often directly affect trade flows. Tracking changes in essential goods imports helps identify how sanctions translate into civilian hardship.


Data Source 4: Household and Social Indicators

To move beyond macro-level analysis, the project includes social and household-level indicators from:

- Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)
- UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS)
- World Bank poverty and inequality data

Key variables include:
- Poverty rate
- Income inequality (Gini index)
- Under-5 child mortality
- Nutrition indicators
- School enrollment (where available)

Relevance:
These indicators provide direct measures of civilian well-being and allow analysis of how economic shocks affect vulnerable populations.


Data Accessibility and Reproducibility

All datasets used in this project are publicly available and free to access. Data can be downloaded directly from official portals or retrieved programmatically using scripts included in the repository.

The repository documents:
- Data sources and download links
- Variable definitions
- Data cleaning procedures
- Aggregation methods

This ensures full transparency and reproducibility of the analysis.
