Data Acquisition II – Database Storage


Overview

To integrate sanctions, trade, macroeconomic, social, and political datasets into a unified analytical structure, a relational database was implemented using SQLite. Organizing the data in a structured relational format ensures consistency, efficient querying, and scalable integration of multiple sources.

The database supports the construction of a harmonized country-year panel dataset suitable for fixed-effects and event-study analysis.


Database Choice

SQLite was selected because it is lightweight, portable, and well-suited for research-scale panel datasets. It integrates seamlessly with Python and pandas, enabling automated data cleaning, transformation, and reproducible database generation.

Its file-based architecture ensures portability and full reproducibility of the empirical workflow.


Database Schema

The database follows a country-year panel design. All tables use standardized country codes and calendar year as primary keys to ensure alignment across datasets.

The schema includes the following core tables:


1. Sanctions Table

This table stores structured sanctions data derived from the Global Sanctions Data Base (GSDB).

Each record includes:

- Country
- Year
- Sanction start indicator
- Sanction active indicator
- Sanction type (financial, trade, sectoral, targeted)
- Duration measures
- Constructed sanction intensity index

This table defines the primary treatment variable in the empirical analysis.


2. Trade Table (Transmission Mechanism)

This table captures trade-related transmission channels using aggregated UN Comtrade data.

Each record includes:

- Country
- Year
- Food imports
- Pharmaceutical imports
- Oil exports
- Fuel imports

These variables measure changes in essential goods flows and allow mechanism testing between sanctions and welfare outcomes.


3. Macroeconomic and Social Indicators Table

This table integrates economic and household-level indicators from the World Bank WDI.

Each record includes:

- Country
- Year
- GDP growth
- Inflation rate
- Unemployment rate
- Poverty rate
- Income inequality (Gini index)
- Under-5 child mortality
- School enrollment

These indicators measure both aggregate economic performance and civilian welfare.


4. Political and Conflict Table

This table includes political and conflict variables to strengthen identification.

Sources include UCDP, Polity V, and Archigos.

Each record includes:

- Country
- Year
- Armed conflict indicator
- Conflict intensity
- Regime type score
- Leadership turnover indicator

These variables allow the analysis to control for war-related shocks and explore potential political instability associated with economic hardship.


Integration Strategy

All tables are joined using country and year as shared keys to construct a consolidated panel dataset.

This structure enables:

- Cross-country comparisons
- Pre- and post-sanction analysis
- Two-way fixed-effects panel regression
- Event-study estimation
- Mediation analysis through trade channels
- Robustness checks controlling for conflict and regime characteristics


Reproducibility

The entire database is generated programmatically using documented Python scripts included in the repository.

The workflow includes:

- Raw data ingestion
- Country code harmonization
- Trade aggregation from product-level data
- Construction of sanction intensity measures
- Panel merging and validation checks

Because the database is built directly from raw public datasets, it can be fully recreated at any time, ensuring transparency, replicability, and methodological rigor appropriate for master’s-level research.
